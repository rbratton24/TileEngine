# TileEngine

Tile Engine using MonoGame this wasa project that I starting working on originally using PlayStation Mobile then ported to MonoGame this Project in still in progress

# The Tiles
I have loaded each tile individually but this can also be done using the one image as well i found it easier this way for right now I plan to implement the single image file later down the road
